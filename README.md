## Pokedex 2.0
This Pokedex 2.0, my second attempt at making a Pokemon encyclopedia on React. It's 
still a work in-progress.

## Implementation üõ†Ô∏è
Pokedex 2.0 was created with Next.js 14, Framer motion, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a load spinner for infinite scrolling.The Pokemons are fetched from Poke API. It makes looking up Pokemons easy with the
search bar implementation. Framer motion adds animation to the card; it allows the cards to scales up when hovered over and flips around when clicked on.

## Technical Stack üß∞

- **Languages and Libraries**: Built with Next.js 14 (a React framework).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion
- **API Integration**: PokeAPI
- **Search Functionality**: Search bar
- **IDE**: Coded in Visual Studio Code.
